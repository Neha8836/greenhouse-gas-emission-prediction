# greenhouse-gas-emission-prediction
This project predicts greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using historical supply chain emission factor data from various US industries and commodities (2015). The goal is to build machine learning regression models that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on quality metrics and other descriptors.

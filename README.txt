Project Title: Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction using Industry Data

Description:
This project uses supply chain emission data from 2015 to predict greenhouse gas emissions using regression models. We visualized top polluting industries and trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models using quality metrics like reliability, temporal correlation, and more.

Steps:
1. Load and clean dataset
2. Visualize top 10 emitting industries
3. Feature selection using quality parameters
4. Model training and evaluation (RÂ², RMSE)
5. Feature importance visualization
6. Saved trained model as best_model_rf.pkl

Tools Used:
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
